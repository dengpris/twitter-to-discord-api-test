# Twitter to Discord API Test
This project uses Twitter streaming API to track the tweets posted by the user in realtime, then crossposts the tweet contents into the Discord channel.

It is a quick project to learn more about APIs and programming in JavaScript.

## Bugs
For some reason Discord will ignore the first message posted to Twitter when starting the stream. It will post all messages following the second tweet.
