# Twitter to Discord API Test
This project uses Twitter streaming API to track the tweets posted by the user in realtime, then crossposts the tweet contents into the Discord channel.

## Bugs
For some reason Discord will ignore the first message posted to Twitter when starting the stream. It will post all messages following the second tweet.
